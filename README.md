# Traffic Collisions Hotspots

Awais Malik, Bartosz Bonczak, Radu Stancut

This project aimed at providing the NYPD with enhanced cognition of traffic collision patterns in New York City by identifying collision hotspots and correlating them with specific enforcement-related causes. Our visualization shows the collision hotspots for each Police Precinct, and identifies the main factors that contributed to these accidents. We also provide collision trends by hour of day for each Precinct. An Overview for the entire City of New York is also presented. Our research shows that the most common causes of accidents are not the usual suspects (such as DUI, alcohol involvement and cell phone use), but rather Driver Inattention, Fatigue/Drowsiness and other improper driving manoeuvres.

All data used is openly available [here](http://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95).
